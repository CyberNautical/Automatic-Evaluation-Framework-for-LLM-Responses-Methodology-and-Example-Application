**I again amended the eval system prompt to tell me why**:

The provided response is largely irrelevant to the context and the specific question posed. It mistakenly introduces "pizza" as part of a coffee product and references a "very very high price," which is contradictory to the expected affordability of the coffee offerings mentioned in the prompt. Moreover, the mention of New York instead of a location in Mainland China deviates from the intended branding and target audience focus, which should resonate with heads of household in Mainland China. Consequently, the response fails to align with the branding strategy or boost brand awareness as intended.

Given these discrepancies and the lack of relevance to the initial objectives, the answer should be rated with a relevance score of:

Rating: 1 star.
```

Which as you can see on a human level makes rational sense. I then extended the variants and observed only rational evaluations that I would score/star the same as the LLM.
